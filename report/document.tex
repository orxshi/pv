	Why Brayton constant pressure?
	Does isothermal always produce more power and efficiency?
	Add more cycles to drawing.
	No boundary work in HE. Only shaft work. vdP. We have increase in volume but we say no boundary work. Why?
	What if we have cylinder-piston configuration? Would we have boundary work or still shaft?
